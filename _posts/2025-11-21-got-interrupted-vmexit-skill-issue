# What is IRQL, even?
IRQL stands for Interrupt Request Level, is an NT thingy. It's stored on CR8 and those fancy functions' (KeRaiseIrql, KeLowerIrql) purpose is to write to it.

An IRQL essentailly defines how "important" the currently running code is. For example, after IRQLs DISPATCH_LEVEL and above, Windows Scheduler cannot interrupt the running core.

Some most commons are (ordered by prioirity):
1. `PASSIVE_LEVEL` - lowest level of IRQL. Every user-moded thread runs in this IRQL.
2. `DISPATCH_LEVEL` - Some kind of "mid" level. The task is not that important but important enough to know that it should not be scheduled in half.
3. `HIGH_LEVEL` - highest level of IRQL (known to Windows). Very, very important tasks (no examples coming to my mind)

After DISPATCH_LEVEL and above, paging is disabled since page fault recovery requires a low IRQL. This is why touching paged memory in high IRQLs often end in tears.

# So what do we do about it?
In a VMEXIT, as Intel manual states, every kind of interrupt is disabled. LAPIC, disabled, device interrupts, gone, clock interrupts, gone.
Even IPIs are gone. I think you know what I mean now.

This level of IRQL restricts **almost** every useful NT function. From `PspTerminateProcess` to `ZwOpenProcess`, as I stated in [this issue](github.com/staarblitz/hxposed/issues/2). 
Unfortunately, the world isn’t all flowers and rainbows, and you can’t just call KeLowerIrql whenever you feel like it. To use those beautiful functions. Even if you *somehow* managed to do it, remember that we are in a VMEXIT.

So what is our best bet? Pending them.

# Cancel safe queues.... But not for IRPs.
Cancel safe queues are amazing. It's a way for user-mode applications to wait for kernel mode driver to respond until something interesting happens. You can learn more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/cancel-safe-irp-queues#ddk-implementing-the-cancel-safe-irp-queue-kg).

What makes them interesting to us is the logic Microsoft uses in their sample code for cancel safe queues. [Here](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/blob/main/general/cancel/sys/cancel.c) it is.

What? You didn't think I was going to setup an I/O Csq for a hypervisor, right?

Right?

# Sync primitives in NT
Basically, in NT architecture, we have waaaay more sync primitives than any of us could ever wish. Ready for your any weird IRQL levels (except ours. Lol imagine acquiring a lock in a VMEXIT) and speed requests.
MSDN provides a document we can read to learn about them in detail. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn613998(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN](Here).

But if you hate Microsoft documentation (I do), the OSR also provides a very, very good explanation of them at [here](https://www.osr.com/nt-insider/2015-issue3/the-state-of-synchronization/).

# Worker threads in kernel mode
First, as it looks like in the polling thread code, we simply neeed a queue (which Rust provides, saving us from `LINKED_LIST`s), a worker thread in PASSIVE_LEVEL.
But which primitive shall w
